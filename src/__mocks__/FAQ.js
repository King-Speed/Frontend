                answer: `Currently, KingSpeed plans to launch 2 modes in renting system that allows users put an unused item 
                         <br></br>  
                         - Mode 1: Fixed price: 
                         <p>
                        + Owners of NFTs can put their unused assets for rent to generate passive interest 
                           </p>
                        <p>
                        + Players who want to experience new, rare, or strong NFTs but can not buy it may rent the NFTs for a period of time 
                         </p>
                        
                        - Mode 2: Share profit
                          <p>
                        + Owners of NFTs can set the share profit rate between owners and renters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For example: Owner 50-50 Renters Owner 70-30 Renters
                         </p>
                        <p>
                        Therefore, even if you don't have time to play, you can still make a profit via this function passively. 
                        Furthermore, we also have a plan to benefit users who hold our tokens in long term. In the beginning, our NFT will be sold at the floor price. For each transaction (buy/sell cars) on the marketplace, the floor price will be increased by 0.5%. You will then gain the benefit when you hold NFTs enough long on the market. When you want to sell your NFT immediately, you can burn it or sell it to Kingspeed with a price equivalent to the floor price.

                        <p>
                        Our aim is to everyone to start playing the Kingspeed game without having to pay a large amount of money to acquire NFTs at the beginning.

                        <p>
                        We give all users the ability to claim and use a simple & generic NFT car with the same basic stats, although NFT cars that are more unique or in special collections will have more advantages than the free, generic NFT cars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We aspire to create a virtual racing universe in the long run. Furthermore, KingSpeed will broaden and transform the audience from traditional games, while improving the gaming experience and incorporating more innovative technologies.
